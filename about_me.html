							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>Hello! I'm Drew White, a current sophomore computer science student at Michigan State University. I am planning to minor in Game Design and Development to bring together my two passions: a love for technology and a love for making stories.</p>
							<p>Since late 2019, I was added to the student-created <a href="https://starforged.net/">Starforged Studios</a> team to be a level/technical designer on their upcoming game <a href="projects.html"><i>Edge</i></a>. Since then, I have worked across teams to bring ideas to life, sculpted meshes, created the floating islands that populate Edge, and worked on puzzle design that will inhabit the games first dungeon. It was and continues to be a fantastic opportunity in that I can gain the first-hand experience of game development along with all of the learning that comes with it.</p>
							<p>Outside of game design, I spend my time working on C++ and Python projects that allow me to push my programming knowledge even further. In terms of stories, I am a self-published author that loves to formulate narratives in a way that is unique and exciting. I also have a great love for movies, from the industry behind them to film itself. </p>
							<p>My resume can be found <a href = "ResumeDW2020.pdf">here</a>. I would love to discuss any opportunities (or anything movies and games, I could never get sick of that.)</p>
